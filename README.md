# Virtual Gallery React

In this project I'll be using the Metropolitian museum of Modern Art's public API to build a virtual Gallery.  I will use this API to curate and host a collection of works for site visitors to view.  On the collection page they'll be able to view the entire current collection, and if they click on a work of art they'll be provided with more details on the work.  There will also be a  browse page which will have a button that will return a random work of art from the MET's over 400,000 works on available on their API. 

## User Story

User's shouldn't have to login to view anything on this site.  They're simply here to view the collections of The MET. Users can browser a curated collection, or they can browse the API on their own on the Browse page.
