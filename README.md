# Virtual Gallery React

For this project I essentially built a React front end for the Art Institute of Chicago's public API. It is designed to be a virtual gallery featuring 3 artist exhibits.  There is also a Browse page that allows visitors to click a button to randomly generate a work of art from the Art institutes database of about 120 thousand works of art.

### Tech Used

Javascript, JSX, React, CSS, React Router, React responsive carousel, React styled components, Node, Grid, icons8

### Next Steps

My future plans for this site are to update either on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Updates would include new artist exhibits, updated styling to reflect the asthetic of the updated exhibits, and new features TBD. I also plan to share this project with the Art institute of Chicago so I can share what I've done with their API.
